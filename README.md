# UDISE CSV Data
CSV data extracted from [UDISE+ reports](https://dashboard.udiseplus.gov.in/#/).

Data is available for UDISE+ reports for 2018-19 to 2023-24.

You can download the ZIP files for each year directly. Each ZIP contains all the CSV files for that year.

Might add older data someday. Send me an email* if you'd like to see it.

\* you can find it on my website
