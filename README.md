# UDISE CSV Data
CSV data extracted from [UDISE reports](https://dashboard.udiseplus.gov.in/#/reportDashboard/state).

Data is available for UDISE 2019-20, UDISE 2020-21 and UDISE 2021-22.

Might add older data someday. Send me an email if you'd like to see it.

## Disclaimer
The rights for the data belong to [DoSEL, MoE, GOI](https://www.education.gov.in/en/school-education) and [NCERT](https://ncert.nic.in/). I have only reorganised it. Don't @ me. Don't cite me.
