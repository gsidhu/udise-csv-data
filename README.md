# UDISE CSV Data
CSV data extracted from [UDISE reports](https://dashboard.udiseplus.gov.in/#/reportDashboard/state).

Data is available for UDISE 2018-19, UDISE 2019-20, UDISE 2020-21 and UDISE 2021-22.

You can download the ZIP files for each year directly. Each ZIP contains all the CSV files for that year.

Might add older data someday. Send me an email* if you'd like to see it.

\* you can find it on my website
